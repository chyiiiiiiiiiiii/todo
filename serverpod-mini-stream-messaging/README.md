# Serverpod Mini Stream Messaging

## Introduction

Serverpod Mini Stream Messaging is a specialized implementation of the Serverpod framework, focusing on real-time messaging capabilities. This project demonstrates how to efficiently handle WebSocket connections and manage message streams, making it ideal for applications that require real-time data synchronization and communication.

## Features

- **WebSocket-Based Messaging:** Supports real-time communication using WebSockets.
- **Stream Management:** Efficiently handles multiple concurrent message streams.
- **Bi-Directional Communication:** Enables full-duplex communication between client and server.
- **Message Broadcasting:** Supports one-to-many message distribution.
- **Connection Management:** Robust handling of client connections and disconnections.

## Usage Examples

```dart
final tasksStream = client.todo.listenTasks();
await for (final todoTasks in tasksStream) {
  setState(() {
    tasks.clear();
    tasks.addAll(todoTasks.tasks);
  });
}
```
